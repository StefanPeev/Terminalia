**Terminalia v.1.004**  
  
All diacritics in the range **` Agrave (uni00C0) : uni021B `** are correctly set as combining glyphs.  
The Cyrillic script now includes the range **` uni0401 : uni045F `**.  
  
**Terminalia v.1.001**  
  
**` gravecomb (uni0300) `** diacritics is now a reflection of **` grave (uni0060) diacritics `**.  
The range of uppercase and lowercase letters with grave diacritics is based on auto layers created from combination of the base letter and **` gravecomb (uni0300) `**.  
**` acutecomb (uni0301) `** diacritics is now a reflection of **` acute (uni00B4) diacritics `**.  
The range of uppercase and lowercase letters with grave diacritics is based on auto layers created from combination of the base letter and **` acutecomb (uni0301) `**.
